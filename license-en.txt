All rights revolted üç• Limo Jiang <the@librian.net>

1. I think copyright law is stupid and should be repealed, so I don't think I have any rights to this repository. That is, I have no rights to grant you.

2. You can do anything with copy of the this repository. Your right to do so is born with you, not granted to you by me.

3. If you really did that, then I have to remind you that you may in fact violated the local law. But my conscience warrants that I will not sue you, so just do things following your own moral judgment.
